# Description
* commands are only given to highest selected group, that being [mobile (attack-)units>Commander/Builder>Buildings]
* holding 'ALT' pressed during command will suppress this behaviour
* you need to created a new "Widgets" folder if one does not already exist in your "~/spring/LuaUI" and put the lua file there
* if a unit doesn't behave as it's supposed to, it is most likely because i forgot it in my list of unitnames, just open an issue or message me otherwise
